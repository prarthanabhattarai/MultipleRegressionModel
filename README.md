# MultipleRegressionModel

I wrote this research paper as a group project for the class Stats 340: Applied Regression Methods. There were two other students in my group.  

In this paper, we have explored the how different attributes of communities affect the rate of crime. We used R for our analysis. This folder contains the final data set and the report as rmd file. 

Here are instructions for opening the file:
1. Upload the technical report and the data set to r studio
2. Open the report and choose ‘knit html’ option
3. Once the report opens up in new window, click on ‘open in browser’ tab

The folder also contains a pdf version of the final report.
